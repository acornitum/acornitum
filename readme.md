# Hi! Welcome to whatever this place of mine is :D

🫡 I go by Acon! I'm a high school senior located somewhere in Ontario, Canada. 

I enjoy competitive programming💻 with a side dish of art🖌️, video editing⏩, and debate🎙️.

My most recent project (updated last at fall 2023) is a 3d platformer/pfs game made in Unity. Hopefully this try won't go down in flames, but we'll see.

### other stuff i had to say

"But Acon-" I hear the one person stalking my profile (you) asking- "why are you even bothering with this 'GitHub' thing?"

Because I like the pretty green squares that show up when you Do Things:tm: on it. It gives me dopamine. That is all.
I've been meaning to do this for a while and I finally figured out how to "commit" this entire "git" thing. I still have no idea what I'm doing. 

If there are no additional pretty green squares beyond this day, it's either because:
- I can't figure out how to commit(?) additional edits(?)
- I've given up on my project
- I've forgotten about the existance of entire thing

Anyways, take your pick. 

And, while you're here, feel free to check out my (maybe existant) projects!
