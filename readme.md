# Hi! Welcome to whatever this place of mine is :D

I go by Acon! I'm a high school senior located somewhere in Ontario, Canada. 

I enjoy competitive programming with a dish of art, video editing, and debate. I'm somewhat good at a lot of things, but not great at anything.

My most current project (updated last at fall 2023) is a 3d platformer/pfs within Unity. Hopefully this try won't go down in flames, but we'll see. 

"But Acon-" I hear the one person stalking my profile (you) asking- "why are you even bothering with this 'GitHub' thing?"

Because I like the pretty green squares that show up when you Do Things:tm: on it. It gives me dopamine. That is all.
I've been meaning to do this for a while and I finally figured out how to "commit" this entire "git" thing. I still have no idea what I'm doing. 

If there are no additional pretty green squares beyond this day, it's either because:
a) I can't figure out how to commit(?) additional edits(?)
b) I've given up on my project
c) I forgot about the existance of entire thing

Anyways, take your pick. 

But until we meet again, cya!
