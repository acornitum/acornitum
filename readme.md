# Hi! Welcome to whatever this place of mine is :D

🫡 I go by Acon! I'm a high school senior located somewhere in Ontario, Canada. 

I enjoy competitive programming💻 with a side dish of art🖌️, video editing⏩, and debate🎙️.

My most recent project (updated last at fall 2023) is a 3d platformer/pfs game made in Unity. Hopefully this try won't go down in flames, but we'll see.
